Assignment 6


The goal of this assignment is to create a tool that analyze stocks
in CSV format and plot the result into a html file. This assignment
tests our understanding of inheritance and continue to test our ability
to work with unfamiliar API.

The goals of this assignment are to:
1. Get you to use objects.
2. Work out solutions incrementally.
3. Play with javascript

This assignment involves the implementation of the CSVParser class that 
loads a csv file and stores each comma separated value as an index in 
the String[][], a stock Simulator that simulates streaming stock data,
analysis tools subclasses that gets high, low, and mean values of the
data. Then the data are written to a JSON file and are displaced as 
html5 graphs that can be viewed in web broswers.

In order to increase the readability of the code and the efficiency of 
the coding process, I commented the methods in Java doc style. I was 
able to  finish and compile the program successfully. The output of 
the progam matches the expectated output.

Compilation:  javac Driver.java
Execution:    java Driver

Data visualization: open highstocks.html, lowstocks.html, and 
meanstocks.html in broswers such as firefox. 

note:Chrome may not work well.
