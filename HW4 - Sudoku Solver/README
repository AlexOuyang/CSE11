This assignment tests our ability to use various loops and arrays.

This assignment was an implementation of a sudoku solver algorithm
using for loops and arrays. In order to increase the readability of 
the code and the effciency of my coding process, I implemented various 
helper methods inside the class to help me implement the algorithm. 
I was able to finish and compile the progam. The output of the progam 
matches the expected output.

The program will read in the table and store it in the "board" variable. 
Use the board variable to solve the Sudoku problem.

Usage: To use the program, you will have to provide a tableX.txt file 
to the program. An example usage:    java Sudoku table1.txt
