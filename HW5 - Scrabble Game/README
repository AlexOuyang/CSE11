 This homework aims to test our ability to create and utilize methods
 and work out solutions incrementally

 This assignment was an implementation of a scrabble-esque game where users 
 will be presented with a number of characters that they will be able to 
 create words from. The game will present the user with a number of different letters and the user is required to guess a word using the existing letters. 

 In order to increase the readability of the code and the efficiency of the 
 coding process, I commented the methods in Java doc style. I was able to 
 finish and compile both part I and II. The output of the progam matches the expectated output.

 Instruction:
 Press number 1 for computer help, press number 2 for all new letters, press number 3 to quit the game.

 Compilation:  javac Words.java
 Execution:    java Words
